HTML and CSS: responsiveness with mobile-firs

In this project I built another website with HTML and CSS.
I understood how to interpret a website prototype created in Figma, as well as know the mobile-first approach.
I understood how and why to use media queries to build responsive layouts. Finally, I deployed a site through github pages.
